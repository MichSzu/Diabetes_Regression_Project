# Pima_Indians_Diabetes
The aim of the project is to create a model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on:
- the number of pregnancies,
- glucose, blood pressure,
- skin thickness,
- insulin,
- BMI,
- genes,
- age.

Data comes from the kaggle website (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
